ðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to my personal page!

I am Liao Shen (**ç”³ç«‹å¥¥** in Chinese), a second-year (2023.09-) master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Zhiguo Cao](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1030/1072.htm). Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from HUST in 2023.   Currently, I am fortunate to be a research associate at [MMLAB@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), advised by Prof. [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/index.html). My research focuses on 3d computer vision, AI Generative Content (AIGC) and bokeh rendering.
