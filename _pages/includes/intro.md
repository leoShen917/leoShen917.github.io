😃 Welcome to my personal page!

I am Tianqi Liu (**刘天齐** in Chinese), a second-year (2023.09-) master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Zhiguo Cao](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1030/1072.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree from HUST in 2023.  My current research interests is 3D vision, working on fast and high-quality 3D reconstructions. To achieve this, my current main research areas include Multi-View Stereo (MVS), Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS).
